# Lost Artifacts

A mod that adds **lost artifacts** scattered all across Hallownest. After obtaining the Sharpened Nail, the player unlocks the Artifacts tab in their inventory, where they may equip artifacts to imbue the nail with an artifact's **trait**. The nail can have up to 4 artifacts equipped: on the head, the two blades, and the handle. Upgrading the nail grants more of these slots, the handle first, the blades, and then the head. The strength of an artifactâ€™s trait depends on what slot it is in: the head gives the trait a level of III, the blades give it a level of II, and the handle gives it a level of I.
