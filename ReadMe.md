# Lost Artifacts

A mod that adds **lost artifacts** scattered all across Hallownest. Obtaining the Sharpened Nail unlocks the Artifacts inventory tab, where the nail can be imbued with an artifact's **trait**. The nail can have up to 4 artifacts equipped: on the head, the two blades, and the handle; the level of the trait depends on which slot it is in. Upgrading the nail grants more of these slots.
