# Lost Artifacts

A mod that adds **lost artifacts** scattered all across Hallownest. After obtaining the Sharpened Nail, the player unlocks the Artifacts tab in their inventory, where they may equip artifacts to imbue the nail with an artifact's **trait**. The nail can have up to 4 artifacts equipped: on the head, the two blades, and the handle. Upgrading the nail grants more of these slots, the handle first, the blades, and then the head. The strength of an artifact’s trait depends on what slot it is in: the head gives the trait a level of III, the blades give it a level of II, and the handle gives it a level of I.

	- Windswept - Hitting an enemy increases movement speed for 5 seconds
