# Lost Artifacts

A mod that adds **lost artifacts** scattered all across Hallownest. Obtaining an artifact unlocks the Artifacts inventory tab, where the nail can be imbued with an artifact's **trait** to give it powerful effects. Upgrading the nail grants more artifact slots, and different slots give traits different levels. With the Pure Nail, slots can even be overcharged to grant an increase in its level. Combine traits, discover synergies, and vanquish enemies using the power of these artifacts!
