# Lost Artifacts

A mod that adds **lost artifacts** scattered all across Hallownest. Obtaining an artifact unlocks the Artifacts inventory tab, where the nail can be imbued with an artifact's **trait** to give it powerful effects. Upgrading the nail grants more artifact slots, and different slots give traits different levels. With the Pure Nail, slots can even be overcharged to grant an increase in its level. Combine traits, discover synergies, and vanquish enemies using the power of these artifacts!

### Dependencies
- SFCore
- Satchel
- ItemChanger

### Inventory Controls
- Jump - Equip and unequip artifacts
- Attack - Switch overcharged slot
- Directions - Move between artifacts or slots

## Integrations

If Randomizer 4 is installed, artifact locations may be randomized through Randomizer's Connections tab. If DebugMod is installed alongside this mod, artifacts or slots can be unlocked through the keybinds menu.

### Randomizer Settings
- Enable artifacts - Places artifacts in the rando save (but does not randomize them)
- Randomize artifacts - Randomizes the artifacts (requires enabling artifacts)
- Use custom locations - Adds the locations listed in SPOILERS.md as custom locations
- Artifact group - Determines which group the artifacts will be randomized into
	- If -1 or 0, artifacts will be randomized with the main item group
	- If above 1, requires using custom locations

### Debug Options
- Unlock all artifacts - unlocks all artifacts
- Toggle unlock all slots - toggles between automatically unlocking all slots and unlocking slots based on nail level
