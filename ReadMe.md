# Lost Artifacts

A mod that adds **lost artifacts** scattered all across Hallownest. Obtaining the Sharpened Nail unlocks the Artifacts inventory tab, where the nail can be imbued with an artifact's **trait** to give it powerful effects. Upgrading the nail grants more artifact slots, and different slots give traits different levels. Combine traits, discover synergies, and vanquish enemies using the power of these artifacts.

Other info: artifacts are placed in the world on a new save; otherwise, you can unlock them using the mod menu.
